## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Extended Platform Support

- **PLAT-01**: macOS support (different injection approach required)
- **PLAT-02**: Qt 6.x as co-primary target (currently secondary)

### Advanced Introspection

- **ADV-01**: State machine visualization
- **ADV-02**: Layout diagnostic overlays

### Security

- **SEC-01**: Authentication for remote connections
- **SEC-02**: Property/method blocklist for sensitive data

### Deployment

- **DEP-01**: vcpkg port
- **DEP-02**: Pre-built binaries for common Qt versions

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| macOS support | Different injection approach, deferred to v1.1 |
| Attach to running process | Adds significant complexity, launch-only for MVP |
| Image-based element recognition | Brittle, slow — use Qt's native object model instead |
| Recording/playback system | High complexity, not core to AI automation |
| Qt 4 support | Legacy, not worth supporting |
| Mobile (Android/iOS) | Different platforms entirely |
| Built-in GUI | Tool is headless; visualization via external tools |
| Plugin system | Adds complexity without clear benefit |
| Custom scripting language | JSON-RPC is sufficient; let AI use native reasoning |
