# QtMCP v1 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1 — Initial Release
**Audited:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** PASSED

## Executive Summary

All 59 v1 requirements satisfied across 7 phases. All cross-phase integration verified. All 5 end-to-end flows complete. Zero critical gaps. One minor discrepancy (qt.names.save not exposed in Python — not required).

## Requirements Coverage

| Phase | Requirements | Satisfied | Coverage |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | INJ-01 to INJ-05 | 5/5 | 100% |
| 2. Core Introspection | OBJ-01 to OBJ-11, SIG-01 to SIG-05, UI-01 to UI-05 | 21/21 | 100% |
| 3. Native Mode | NAT-01 to NAT-05 | 5/5 | 100% |
| 4. Computer Use Mode | CU-01 to CU-10 | 10/10 | 100% |
| 5. Chrome Mode | CHR-01 to CHR-08 | 8/8 | 100% |
| 6. Extended Introspection | QML-01 to QML-05, MV-01 to MV-04 | 9/9 | 100% |
| 7. Python Integration | PY-01 to PY-05, CLI-01 to CLI-04 | 9/9 | 100% |
| **Total** | | **59/59** | **100%** |

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Verified | Key Evidence |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Foundation | PASSED | 5/5 | 2026-01-30 | DLL injection, WebSocket, JSON-RPC all human-verified |
| 2. Core Introspection | PASSED | 5/5 | 2026-01-30 | 21 JSON-RPC methods, 97+ test cases, 2200+ lines |
| 3. Native Mode | PASSED | 5/5 | 2026-01-31 | 29 qt.* methods, 824-line test suite, zero regressions |
| 4. Computer Use Mode | PASSED | 5/5 | 2026-01-31 | 13 cu.* methods, 3 UAT gaps found and closed |
| 5. Chrome Mode | PASSED | 14/14 | 2026-02-01 | 8 chr.* methods, 788-line test suite, 55 role mappings |
| 6. Extended Introspection | PASSED | 4/4 | 2026-02-01 | QML inspector, ModelNavigator, 18 test functions |
| 7. Python Integration | PASSED | 5/5 | 2026-02-01 | 53 MCP tools, 12 unit tests, README with config |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration Health: 100%**

| Category | Score | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Cross-Phase Wiring | 13/13 connections | All phase exports consumed correctly |
| Shared Infrastructure | 100% | ObjectRegistry, InputSimulator, MetaInspector shared across APIs |
| API Coverage | 53/54 methods | 1 excluded by design (qt.names.save) |
| Orphaned Exports | 0 | No unused phase deliverables |
| Missing Connections | 0 | All expected links present |

### Probe Initialization Chain (Verified)

```
DllMain (minimal) → Q_COREAPP_STARTUP_FUNCTION → Probe::initialize()
  → WebSocketServer (port 9222)
  → NativeModeApi (33 qt.* methods)
  → ComputerUseModeApi (13 cu.* methods)
  → ChromeModeApi (8 chr.* methods)
  → ConsoleMessageCapture
  → SignalMonitor push forwarding
```

### Python MCP Tool Mapping (Verified)

```
Native:  32 Python tools → 32 qt.* probe methods
CU:      13 Python tools → 13 cu.* probe methods
Chrome:   8 Python tools →  8 chr.* probe methods
Total:   53 tools, all calling get_probe().call() with correct method names
```

## End-to-End Flows

All 5 flows verified complete:

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1. Launch → Inject → Connect → Discover → Interact | 9 steps | COMPLETE |
| 2. Native Mode full cycle (tree → info → get → set → invoke) | 5 steps | COMPLETE |
| 3. Computer Use full cycle (screenshot → click → type → verify) | 4 steps | COMPLETE |
| 4. Chrome Mode full cycle (readPage → find → click → formInput → text) | 5 steps | COMPLETE |
| 5. QML + Model introspection (tree → qml.inspect → models.list → models.data) | 4 steps | COMPLETE |

## Error Handling

Consistent error propagation across all phases:

```
API method → JsonRpcException(ErrorCode) → JsonRpcHandler → WebSocket → ProbeConnection → ProbeError → FastMCP → Claude
```

32 error codes defined across 10 domains (-32001 to -32099).

## UAT Test Results

| Phase | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Phase 1 | 7/7 | PASSED |
| Phase 3 | 13/13 | PASSED |
| Phase 4 | 6/6 | PASSED |
| Phase 7 | 8/8 | PASSED |
| **Total** | **34/34** | **100%** |

## Automated Test Results

12 test suites, all passing. Total test time: ~5 seconds.

## Tech Debt (Non-Critical)

1. **qt.names.save** — Registered in probe (Phase 3) but not exposed as Python MCP tool. Not required by any requirement. The name map is auto-saved internally.

## Gap Closures During Development

| Gap | Phase | Plan | Resolution |
|-----|-------|------|------------|
| NativeModeApi silent failure in DLL context | 4 | 04-04 | Try/catch around API registration |
| Legacy qtmcp.* param name mismatch | 4 | 04-04 | objectId fallback in 11 methods |
| cu.cursorPosition read OS cursor | 4 | 04-05 | Virtual cursor tracking |
| chr.find ref map wipe + name fallback | 5 | 05-04 | Fixed ref persistence and name resolution |
| getTopLevelObjects missing QCoreApplication | 3 | 03-04 | Added QCoreApplication to search roots |

All gaps closed. No outstanding issues.

## Conclusion

**QtMCP v1 milestone is COMPLETE.**

- 59/59 requirements satisfied
- 7/7 phases verified
- 5/5 E2E flows complete
- 53 MCP tools mapped to probe methods
- 34/34 UAT tests passed
- 12/12 automated test suites passed
- Zero critical gaps

The system is production-ready for release.
