# Requirements: QtMCP v1.1

**Defined:** 2026-02-01
**Core Value:** Claude can control any Qt application with zero learning curve

## v1.1 Requirements

### Build System

- [x] **BUILD-01**: Probe output encodes Qt version in filename (e.g. `qtmcp-probe-qt5.15.dll`, `qtmcp-probe-qt6.8.so`)
- [x] **BUILD-02**: QtMCPConfig.cmake.in works for both Qt5 and Qt6 consumers (templated with QT_VERSION_MAJOR)
- [x] **BUILD-03**: CMake install targets produce versioned, relocatable artifacts with proper install components

### CI/CD

- [x] **CICD-01**: GitHub Actions matrix builds probe for Qt 5.15 on Windows (MSVC) and Linux (GCC)
- [x] **CICD-02**: GitHub Actions matrix builds probe for Qt 6.5 on Windows (MSVC) and Linux (GCC)
- [x] **CICD-03**: GitHub Actions matrix builds probe for Qt 6.8 on Windows (MSVC) and Linux (GCC)
- [x] **CICD-04**: GitHub Actions matrix builds probe for Qt 6.9 on Windows (MSVC) and Linux (GCC)
- [x] **CICD-05**: CI builds custom-patched Qt 5.15.1 from source with aggressive caching
- [x] **CICD-06**: CI builds probe against patched Qt 5.15.1 on Windows (MSVC) and Linux (GCC)
- [x] **CICD-07**: Tag-triggered release workflow collects all 10 probe binaries into GitHub Release
- [x] **CICD-08**: Release includes SHA256 checksums for all artifacts

### Qt Compatibility

- [x] **COMPAT-01**: Source compiles against Qt 5.15 and Qt 6.x without deprecation warnings

### Packaging — vcpkg

- [x] **VCPKG-01**: Source overlay port builds probe against user's Qt installation (no qtbase vcpkg dependency)
- [x] **VCPKG-02**: Binary overlay port downloads prebuilt probe from GitHub Releases
- [x] **VCPKG-03**: Port works with both Qt5 and Qt6 installations

### Packaging — PyPI

- [x] **PYPI-01**: Python MCP server publishable as pure-Python wheel to PyPI
- [x] **PYPI-02**: `pip install qtmcp` installs working MCP server with CLI entry point
- [x] **PYPI-03**: `qtmcp download-probe` CLI command fetches correct probe binary for user's Qt version from GitHub Releases
- [x] **PYPI-04**: PyPI publishing uses Trusted Publishers (OIDC), not API tokens
