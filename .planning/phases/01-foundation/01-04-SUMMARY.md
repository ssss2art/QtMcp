# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-02
    provides: Probe singleton with platform-specific initialization
  - phase: 01-03
    provides: JsonRpcHandler for message processing
provides:
  - WebSocket server with single-client semantics
  - Message routing from WebSocket to JsonRpcHandler
  - Probe integration with automatic server startup
  - Startup message to stderr for debugging

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Single-client WebSocket (reject additional connections)
    - Signal forwarding (server -> Probe -> external)

    - src/probe/core/probe.h
    - src/probe/core/probe.cpp

key-decisions:
  - "Single-client semantics per CONTEXT.md - reject with CloseCodePolicyViolated"
  - "Server continues listening after disconnect for reconnection"
  - "Startup message to stderr for debugging injection"

patterns-established:
  - "WebSocket server lifecycle: Probe creates/starts, stop() on shutdown"
  - "Signal forwarding: child signals connected to parent for external monitoring"

# Phase 1 Plan 4: WebSocket Server Summary

**Single-client WebSocket server using QWebSocketServer with automatic rejection of concurrent connections and JSON-RPC message routing**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-30T13:34:13Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-30T13:40:19Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- WebSocket server with single-client semantics (reject additional connections)
- Integration with Probe::initialize() for automatic server startup
- Message routing from WebSocket to JsonRpcHandler
- Startup message "QtMCP listening on ws://0.0.0.0:{port}" to stderr

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create WebSocketServer class** - `4ca0ddf` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Integrate WebSocketServer with Probe** - `ded69b5` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/probe/transport/websocket_server.h` - Single-client WebSocket server header with QTMCP_EXPORT
- `src/probe/transport/websocket_server.cpp` - Implementation with connection rejection logic
- `src/probe/core/probe.h` - Added server() accessor method
- `src/probe/core/probe.cpp` - WebSocket server creation, signal connections, shutdown

## Decisions Made
- **Single-client semantics:** Per CONTEXT.md, only one client allowed at a time. Additional connections rejected with QWebSocketProtocol::CloseCodePolicyViolated.
- **Server persistence:** Server continues listening after client disconnect, ready for reconnection.
- **Signal forwarding:** Server signals (clientConnected, clientDisconnected, errorOccurred) forwarded to Probe signals for external monitoring.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
- Existing WebSocketServer had multi-client semantics; rewrote with single-client logic per plan requirements.

## Next Phase Readiness
- WebSocket transport layer complete
- JSON-RPC messages routed to handler
- Ready for Object Registry (01-05) to add qtmcp.* method implementations
- Full integration testing requires Qt DLLs in PATH (noted in previous plans)
