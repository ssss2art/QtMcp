### Anti-Patterns Found

No blocking anti-patterns detected.

**Scan Results:**
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments in implementation files
- No stub patterns ("not implemented", "coming soon")
- No empty function implementations
- Empty returns are only null guards (if (!obj) return empty)

**Code Quality Metrics:**
- ObjectRegistry: 394 lines (substantive)
- object_id: 339 lines (substantive)
- meta_inspector: 335 lines (substantive)
- signal_monitor: 323 lines (substantive)
- variant_json: 136 lines (substantive)
- input_simulator: 108 lines (substantive)
- jsonrpc_handler: 570 lines (21 method registrations)
- Total Phase 2 code: 2200+ lines of implementation

**Test Coverage:**
- 7 test files created
- 97+ test cases (verified via void test pattern count)
- 2582 lines of test code
- All 7 test suites reported passing in 02-07-SUMMARY.md

### Human Verification Required

While all automated checks pass, the following should be verified by running the application:

#### 1. Object Discovery via WebSocket

**Test:** Launch test app with probe, connect WebSocket client, send findByObjectName request
**Expected:** Response contains object ID in hierarchical format
**Why human:** Requires running application and WebSocket client

#### 2. Signal Subscription Push Notifications

**Test:** Subscribe to a button clicked signal, then click the button in the UI
**Expected:** WebSocket client receives signalEmitted notification
**Why human:** Requires real-time interaction and WebSocket connection

#### 3. Screenshot Capture

**Test:** Send qtmcp.screenshot request for a visible widget
**Expected:** Receive base64 PNG image that accurately represents the widget
**Why human:** Visual validation required

#### 4. Input Simulation

**Test:** Use qtmcp.click to click a button, then verify button clicked handler executed
**Expected:** Button responds as if user clicked it
**Why human:** Requires observing UI state changes

#### 5. Hit Testing Accuracy

**Test:** Send qtmcp.hitTest with coordinates over a known widget
**Expected:** Returns correct widget hierarchical ID
**Why human:** Coordinate accuracy needs visual confirmation

## Verification Summary

**All 5 observable truths VERIFIED through code inspection:**
1. Object discovery methods exist and are wired to JSON-RPC
2. Hierarchical ID system implemented with generateObjectId()
3. Property/method introspection and mutation implemented
4. Signal subscription system with push notification forwarding
5. UI interaction primitives using QTest and Qt widget APIs

**All required artifacts VERIFIED:**
- 16/16 files exist and are substantive (10+ lines, no stubs)
- All exports present in headers
- All implementations use appropriate Qt APIs

**All key links VERIFIED:**
- 15/15 critical connections wired correctly
- ObjectRegistry uses qtHookData hooks
- JSON-RPC methods call introspection APIs
- SignalMonitor notifications forwarded to WebSocket

**Requirements: 20/20 satisfied (100%)**

**Test coverage: 7 test suites, 97+ test cases, 2582 lines**

**Phase 2 Goal ACHIEVED:** Probe can discover, inspect, and interact with any QObject in the target application.
