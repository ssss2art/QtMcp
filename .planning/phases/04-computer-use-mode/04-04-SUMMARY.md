# Phase 04 Plan 04: UAT Gap Closure - Probe Resilience Summary

**One-liner:** Independent try/catch for API registration + objectId param fallback on all 11 legacy methods

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Exception handling around API instantiation
- Wrapped NativeModeApi and ComputerUseModeApi constructors in separate try/catch blocks in `Probe::initialize()`
- Each block catches both `std::exception` and `...` (unknown exceptions)
- Success/failure logged to stderr with `fprintf` (safe pre-Qt-init)
- Added `#include <stdexcept>` to probe.cpp
- **Commit:** 68f9a9a

### Task 2: Backward-compat objectId param support
- Updated all 11 legacy `qtmcp.*` methods that read an object ID parameter
- Each now tries `"id"` first, falls back to `"objectId"` if empty
- Methods updated: getObjectInfo, listProperties, getProperty, setProperty, listMethods, invokeMethod, listSignals, click, sendKeys, screenshot, getGeometry
- Existing clients using `"id"` are completely unaffected
- **Commit:** 9e50143

## Verification

- Build: `cmake --build build` succeeds with no new warnings
- Tests: All 10 test suites pass (100%) with zero regressions
- stderr output now shows API registration success/failure messages
- Legacy methods accept both "id" and "objectId" parameter names

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Separate try/catch per API | NativeModeApi failure (observed in DLL injection) must not block ComputerUseModeApi |
| fprintf for registration logging | Safe before Qt logging is fully initialized in DLL context |
| objectId fallback on all 11 methods | Plan specified getObjectInfo and getGeometry but all legacy methods benefit from consistency |

## Commits

| Hash | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 68f9a9a | fix | Exception handling around API instantiation in probe |
| 9e50143 | fix | objectId param fallback to legacy qtmcp.* methods |
