# Phase 4: Computer Use Mode Re-Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** AI agents can control Qt applications using screenshot and pixel coordinates  
**Verified:** 2026-01-31T22:15:00Z  
**Status:** passed  
**Re-verification:** Yes — after gap closure (plans 04-04, 04-05)

## Re-Verification Summary

Previous verification (2026-02-01T02:47:15Z) passed with 5/5 truths verified. However, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) discovered 3 gaps in real-world usage:

1. **Gap 1 (Major):** NativeModeApi silently failed during DLL injection, making all qt.* methods unavailable
2. **Gap 2 (Major):** Legacy qtmcp.* methods only accepted id param, not objectId, causing confusion
3. **Gap 3 (Minor):** cu.cursorPosition read physical OS cursor instead of simulated position from CU actions

Gap closure plans 04-04 and 04-05 addressed all three issues. This re-verification confirms the gaps are closed.

## Gap Closure Verification

### Gap 1: API Registration Resilience (04-04)

**Previous Issue:** NativeModeApi constructor threw exception during DLL injection with no error handling, causing silent failure. All qt.* methods returned -32601 Method not found.

**Fix Verification:**
- probe.cpp lines 158-167: NativeModeApi wrapped in try/catch with stderr logging
- probe.cpp lines 169-178: ComputerUseModeApi wrapped in independent try/catch
- Each catch block logs to stderr with fprintf (safe pre-Qt-init)
- Failure of one API does not prevent the other from registering
- Build succeeds, all tests pass

**Status:** CLOSED

### Gap 2: Legacy Parameter Backward Compatibility (04-04)

**Previous Issue:** Legacy qtmcp.getObjectInfo and qtmcp.getGeometry only read id parameter, but clients using modern qt.* convention naturally pass objectId. This caused Object not found errors.

**Fix Verification:**
- jsonrpc_handler.cpp: 11 instances of objectId fallback pattern
- All legacy methods that accept object ID now support both parameter names
- Backward compatible: existing clients using id are unaffected
- Build succeeds, all tests pass

**Methods Updated (11 total):**  
qtmcp.getObjectInfo, qtmcp.listProperties, qtmcp.getProperty, qtmcp.setProperty, qtmcp.listMethods, qtmcp.invokeMethod, qtmcp.listSignals, qtmcp.click, qtmcp.sendKeys, qtmcp.screenshot, qtmcp.getGeometry

**Status:** CLOSED

### Gap 3: Virtual Cursor Position Tracking (04-05)

**Previous Issue:** cu.cursorPosition used QCursor::pos() which reads physical OS cursor. cu.mouseMove sent QMouseEvents without moving OS cursor. Result: cursorPosition always returned physical mouse location, not where CU interactions were happening.

**Fix Verification:**
- computer_use_mode_api.cpp: Static s_lastSimulatedPosition tracking variables added
- trackPosition() helper converts local/global coords to screen-absolute
- 9 coordinate-based methods call trackPosition()
- cu.cursorPosition prefers virtual position when available, falls back to QCursor::pos()
- Response includes virtual field (additive, backward compatible)
- Build succeeds, all tests pass

**Status:** CLOSED

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

All 5 truths from initial verification remain verified. No regressions.

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User can request screenshot and receive base64 PNG image | VERIFIED | cu.screenshot returns image, width, height |
| 2 | User can perform all mouse actions at pixel coordinates | VERIFIED | All cu.* mouse methods functional |
| 3 | User can type text and send key combinations at current focus | VERIFIED | cu.type and cu.key functional |
| 4 | User can scroll in any direction at specified coordinates | VERIFIED | cu.scroll functional |
| 5 | User can query current cursor position | VERIFIED | cu.cursorPosition returns virtual position |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified (maintained)

### Required Artifacts

All original artifacts verified, plus gap closure changes:

**Core Artifacts (04-01, 04-02, 04-03):**
- key_name_mapper.h/cpp: 155 lines, 60+ Chrome/xdotool key mappings
- input_simulator.h/cpp: Mouse and keyboard event simulation
- screenshot.h/cpp: Full-screen and logical-pixel capture
- computer_use_mode_api.h/cpp: 658 lines, 13 cu.* method registrations
- test_key_name_mapper.cpp: 213 lines
- test_computer_use_api.cpp: 540 lines

**Gap Closure Artifacts (04-04, 04-05):**
- src/probe/core/probe.cpp: Exception handling around API registration
- src/probe/transport/jsonrpc_handler.cpp: objectId fallback in 11 methods
- src/probe/api/computer_use_mode_api.cpp: Virtual cursor tracking

**Status:** All exist, substantive, and wired

### Requirements Coverage

All 10 Phase 4 requirements satisfied:

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| CU-01: Screenshot returns base64 PNG | SATISFIED |
| CU-02: Left click at coordinates | SATISFIED |
| CU-03: Right click at coordinates | SATISFIED |
| CU-04: Double click at coordinates | SATISFIED |
| CU-05: Mouse move to coordinates | SATISFIED |
| CU-06: Click and drag | SATISFIED |
| CU-07: Type text | SATISFIED |
| CU-08: Send key combinations | SATISFIED |
| CU-09: Scroll | SATISFIED |
| CU-10: Get cursor position | SATISFIED |

**Coverage:** 10/10 requirements satisfied

### Build and Test Results

**Build Status:** PASSED

**Test Results:** ALL PASSED (10/10 test suites, 2.45 seconds)

**Regressions:** None

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. All code follows existing patterns and conventions.

## Summary

Phase 4 (Computer Use Mode) has fully achieved its goal after gap closure.

**Timeline:**
- Initial Verification (2026-02-01): 5/5 truths verified
- UAT Discovery (2026-01-31): 3 gaps found
- Gap Closure (2026-01-31): Plans 04-04, 04-05 executed
- Re-Verification (2026-01-31): All gaps closed

**Key Achievements:**
- 13 cu.* methods functional
- Resilient API initialization
- Backward compatible legacy methods
- Virtual cursor tracking
- All requirements satisfied
- Zero regressions

**Phase Status:** COMPLETE
