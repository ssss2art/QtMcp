# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-foundation
    provides: WebSocket probe server that this Python client connects to
provides:
  - Python package skeleton with pyproject.toml and CLI entry point
  - ProbeConnection async WebSocket JSON-RPC client
  - FastMCP server factory with lifespan-managed connection
  - Status resource at qtmcp://status
  - Stub tool registration files for native/cu/chrome modes
affects: [07-02, 07-03]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: [fastmcp 2.x, websockets 14+, hatchling]
  patterns: [lifespan context manager for connection lifecycle, module-level probe reference, argparse CLI]

key-files:
  created:
    - python/pyproject.toml
    - python/src/qtmcp/__init__.py
    - python/src/qtmcp/__main__.py
    - python/src/qtmcp/cli.py

    - python/src/qtmcp/tools/chrome.py
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "Module-level probe reference instead of Context.lifespan_context (FastMCP v2 stores lifespan result on server, not context)"
  - "asynccontextmanager lifespan pattern with try/finally for cleanup"
  - "Stub tool files created immediately so server factory imports work end-to-end"

patterns-established:
  - "ProbeConnection pattern: async connect/disconnect/call with Future-based response correlation"
  - "Server factory pattern: create_server() returns configured FastMCP with mode-specific tools"
  - "Module-level get_probe()/get_mode() for tool/resource access to connection state"

# Phase 7 Plan 1: Package Skeleton Summary

**Python MCP package with FastMCP server factory, async WebSocket JSON-RPC client, and CLI entry point supporting native/cu/chrome modes**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-01T19:53:52Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-01T20:02:10Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 11

## Accomplishments
- ProbeConnection class with async WebSocket JSON-RPC 2.0 request/response correlation
- FastMCP server factory with lifespan-managed connection and auto-launch subprocess support
- CLI with --mode, --ws-url, --target, --port, --launcher-path arguments
- Status resource exposing connection state at qtmcp://status
- Stub tool registration files ready for Plans 02 and 03

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Package skeleton + CLI + Connection class** - `c629c85` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Server factory + Status resource** - `fc0de9b` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `python/pyproject.toml` - Package metadata with fastmcp/websockets deps and CLI entry point
- `python/src/qtmcp/__init__.py` - Package init with version
- `python/src/qtmcp/__main__.py` - python -m qtmcp support
- `python/src/qtmcp/cli.py` - CLI entry point with argparse
- `python/src/qtmcp/connection.py` - ProbeConnection async WebSocket JSON-RPC client
- `python/src/qtmcp/server.py` - create_server() factory with lifespan pattern
- `python/src/qtmcp/status.py` - Status resource registration
- `python/src/qtmcp/tools/__init__.py` - Tools package init
- `python/src/qtmcp/tools/native.py` - Native mode stub
- `python/src/qtmcp/tools/cu.py` - Computer Use mode stub
- `python/src/qtmcp/tools/chrome.py` - Chrome mode stub

## Decisions Made
- Used module-level `_probe` reference with `get_probe()` accessor instead of `Context.lifespan_context` -- FastMCP v2.14 stores lifespan result on server object, not directly accessible from Context
- Created stub tool registration files so server factory imports work end-to-end without waiting for Plans 02/03
- Used `asynccontextmanager` for lifespan with try/finally ensuring cleanup of both WebSocket and subprocess

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Package skeleton complete, `python -m qtmcp --help` works
- ProbeConnection ready for tool implementations to call `conn.call(method, params)`
- Stub files in place for Plan 02 (native + CU tools) and Plan 03 (chrome tools)
- FastMCP installed and verified working (v2.14.4)
