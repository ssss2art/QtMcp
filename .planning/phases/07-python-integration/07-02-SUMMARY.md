# Phase 07 Plan 02: Tool Definitions Summary

**53 async MCP tool functions across 3 mode files, each a thin bridge to probe JSON-RPC methods**

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Native mode tools (32 qt_* functions)
- **Commit:** ee8fd66
- Replaced stub in `native.py` with `register_native_tools(mcp)` containing 32 `@mcp.tool` async functions
- Coverage: ping, version, modes, objects (find/findByClass/tree/info/inspect/query), properties (list/get/set), methods (list/invoke), signals (list/subscribe/unsubscribe/setLifecycle), UI (click/sendKeys/screenshot/geometry/hitTest), names (register/unregister/list/validate/load), QML (inspect), models (list/info/data)
- All optional params use `None` defaults and are excluded from JSON-RPC params dict when not provided

### Task 2: Computer Use + Chrome mode tools (21 functions)
- **Commit:** dc39a4b
- `cu.py`: 13 cu_* tools -- screenshot, leftClick, rightClick, middleClick, doubleClick, mouseMove, mouseDrag, mouseDown, mouseUp, type, key, scroll, cursorPosition
- `chrome.py`: 8 chr_* tools -- readPage, click, formInput, getPageText, find, navigate, tabsContext, readConsoleMessages
- Same thin bridge pattern: async, get_probe(), call(), return result

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Deferred import of get_probe() inside each tool | Avoids circular imports since server.py imports tool modules |
| ctx: Context parameter on every tool | Required by FastMCP for tool registration |

## Verification Results

- All three files import without errors
- Function counts verified: 32 native + 13 cu + 8 chrome = 53 tools
- Every tool calls `get_probe().call()` with correct JSON-RPC method prefix
- No print() statements in any tool file
- Docstrings are minimal (1 sentence + 1 example)

## Next Phase Readiness

Plan 07-03 (CLI + packaging) can proceed. All tool functions are registered and ready for end-to-end use once a probe is connected.
