# Phase 7 Plan 3: README and Tests Summary

README with copy-paste Claude Desktop/Code config for all three modes plus unit tests with MockWebSocket verifying JSON-RPC format and tool registration counts.

## What Was Done

### Task 1: README with Configuration Snippets
Created comprehensive README.md covering:
- Installation instructions (pip and uv)
- Quick start command
- Claude Desktop JSON config blocks for all 3 modes (native, cu, chrome)
- Connect-to-running and auto-launch config patterns for each mode
- Windows `cmd /c` wrapper pattern for Claude Desktop
- Claude Code `claude mcp add` commands for all 3 modes
- CLI reference table with all arguments and environment variables
- Mode descriptions with tool counts
- Architecture ASCII diagram

### Task 2: Unit Tests with Mock WebSocket
Created test suite with 12 tests:

**conftest.py:**
- MockWebSocket class simulating WebSocket with sent_messages recording and pre-configured responses
- mock_probe fixture with AsyncMock patching websockets.connect
- mock_mcp fixture for tool registration testing

**test_connection.py (6 tests):**
- test_call_sends_jsonrpc_format: verifies JSON-RPC 2.0 message structure
- test_call_increments_id: verifies sequential ID generation
- test_call_returns_result: verifies result extraction from response
- test_call_raises_probe_error: verifies error response handling
- test_is_connected_property: verifies connection state tracking
- test_call_when_disconnected_raises: verifies guard against disconnected calls

**test_tools.py (6 tests):**
- test_native_tools_registered: >= 32 native tools
- test_native_tool_names: key qt_* names present
- test_cu_tools_registered: exactly 13 cu tools
- test_cu_tool_names: key cu_* names present
- test_chrome_tools_registered: exactly 8 chrome tools
- test_chrome_tool_names: key chr_* names present

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] AsyncMock required for websockets.connect patching**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** `patch("qtmcp.connection.connect", return_value=mock_ws)` fails because `connect` is async; `await` on a plain mock raises TypeError
- **Fix:** Used `AsyncMock(return_value=mock_ws)` to provide proper awaitable
- **Files modified:** python/tests/conftest.py
- **Commit:** 3f89bea

## Verification Results

All verification criteria met:
1. python/README.md exists with all config sections
2. 12/12 tests pass in 0.19s
3. README contains config for all 3 modes x 2 platforms
4. README contains auto-launch config pattern
5. README contains Windows cmd /c pattern
6. Tests verify 32 native, 13 cu, 8 chrome tools registered

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 7 (Python Integration) is now complete. All 3 plans delivered:
- 07-01: Package skeleton and core infrastructure
- 07-02: 53 tool definitions across 3 modes
- 07-03: README documentation and test suite

The entire QtMCP project (32 plans across 7 phases) is complete.
