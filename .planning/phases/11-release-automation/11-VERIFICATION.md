# Phase 11: Release Automation Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Pushing a version tag automatically produces a complete GitHub Release with all binaries
**Verified:** 2026-02-02T15:46:03Z
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Pushing a v* tag triggers the release workflow | ✓ VERIFIED | release.yml lines 3-5: on.push.tags contains v* |
| 2 | Release workflow calls both ci.yml and ci-patched-qt.yml to build all 10 artifacts | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 14-21: build-standard job uses ci.yml, build-patched job uses ci-patched-qt.yml |
| 3 | All 10 probe binaries appear on the GitHub Release page with correct filenames | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 38-49: ARTIFACTS array contains exactly 10 entries mapping to release filenames with platform encoding |
| 4 | A SHA256SUMS file is included in the release | ✓ VERIFIED | Line 77: sha256sum generates checksums for all release assets |
| 5 | Release is created automatically with tag name as title | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 82-87: softprops/action-gh-release@v2 with generate_release_notes and fail_on_unmatched_files |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified


### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| .github/workflows/release.yml | Tag-triggered release workflow containing softprops/action-gh-release, 60+ lines | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (87 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (no stubs, complete implementation), WIRED (called by Git tag push trigger) |

**Artifact Analysis:**

**Level 1 - Existence:** ✓ PASSED
- File exists at .github/workflows/release.yml

**Level 2 - Substantive:** ✓ PASSED
- Line count: 87 lines (exceeds 60-line minimum by 45%)
- No stub patterns found (0 matches for TODO/FIXME/placeholder/coming soon)
- Contains all required elements:
  - Tag trigger: push.tags with v* pattern
  - Permissions: contents write
  - Reusable workflow calls to both CI workflows
  - Artifact download and extraction logic
  - SHA256 checksum generation
  - GitHub Release creation
  - Error handling (exit 1 if probe not found)
- Export check: N/A (workflow file, not code module)

**Level 3 - Wired:** ✓ VERIFIED
- Trigger: Git tag push with v* pattern
- Calls: ./.github/workflows/ci.yml (line 15)
- Calls: ./.github/workflows/ci-patched-qt.yml (line 21)
- Action: actions/download-artifact@v4 (line 32)
- Action: softprops/action-gh-release@v2 (line 83)
- Dependencies: needs build-standard and build-patched (line 28) ensures sequential execution

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| release.yml | ci.yml | uses ./.github/workflows/ci.yml | ✓ WIRED | Line 15: workflow_call trigger in ci.yml verified at line 23 |
| release.yml | ci-patched-qt.yml | uses ./.github/workflows/ci-patched-qt.yml | ✓ WIRED | Line 21: workflow_call trigger in ci-patched-qt.yml verified at line 16 |
| release.yml | GitHub Release | softprops/action-gh-release@v2 | ✓ WIRED | Lines 82-87: action configured with files glob, generate_release_notes, fail_on_unmatched_files |
| ARTIFACTS array | probe binaries | find command with platform-encoded filenames | ✓ WIRED | Lines 38-74: loops over 10 artifact entries, uses find to locate binaries, copies with correct release names, includes error handling |

**Key Link Deep Dive:**

**Link 1: release.yml to ci.yml**
- Verified: ci.yml contains workflow_call trigger at line 23
- Pattern match: uses ./.github/workflows/ci.yml found at release.yml line 15
- Artifact production: ci.yml produces 8 artifacts (4 Qt versions x 2 platforms)

**Link 2: release.yml to ci-patched-qt.yml**
- Verified: ci-patched-qt.yml contains workflow_call trigger at line 16
- Pattern match: uses ./.github/workflows/ci-patched-qt.yml found at release.yml line 21
- Artifact production: ci-patched-qt.yml produces 2 artifacts (Qt 5.15 patched x 2 platforms)

**Link 3: Artifact extraction to Release filenames**
- Mapping logic: 10 ARTIFACTS array entries (lines 38-49) map artifact directory names to release filenames
- Naming pattern: qtmcp-probe-{qt_tag}-{platform}.{ext} correctly encodes platform to distinguish otherwise identical binaries
- Error handling: Script exits with error if any probe is missing (line 63: exit 1)
- Windows import libraries: Also copies .lib files for Windows artifacts (lines 67-73)

**Link 4: Release creation**
- Files glob: release-assets/* uploads all extracted assets (line 85)
- Checksum included: SHA256SUMS generated before upload (line 77)
- Fail-safe: fail_on_unmatched_files true ensures release fails if glob does not match (line 87)
- Release notes: generate_release_notes true auto-generates changelog (line 86)


### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| CICD-07: Tag-triggered release workflow collects all 10 probe binaries into GitHub Release | ✓ SATISFIED | None — workflow structure complete, calls both CI workflows, extracts all 10 binaries |
| CICD-08: Release includes SHA256 checksums for all artifacts | ✓ SATISFIED | None — line 77 generates SHA256SUMS covering all release assets |

**Requirements Analysis:**

Both requirements mapped to Phase 11 are structurally satisfied by the implementation:

- **CICD-07**: The workflow calls both ci.yml (8 artifacts) and ci-patched-qt.yml (2 artifacts) as reusable workflows, downloads all artifacts, extracts probe binaries with platform-encoded filenames, and uploads them to the GitHub Release. The ARTIFACTS array explicitly lists all 10 probe configurations.

- **CICD-08**: Line 77 runs sha256sum to generate SHA256SUMS in the release-assets directory, which will include checksums for all 10 probe binaries plus 5 Windows .lib import libraries (15 binary files total). The SHA256SUMS file itself is then included in the release assets.

### Anti-Patterns Found

**Scan results:** No anti-patterns detected.

| Category | Findings |
|----------|----------|
| TODO/FIXME comments | 0 matches |
| Placeholder content | 0 matches |
| Empty implementations | 0 matches (all steps have real logic) |
| Console.log only | N/A (shell script, not code) |

**Analysis:**

The release.yml workflow is a complete, production-ready implementation with no stub patterns. Key quality indicators:

1. **Error handling:** Script exits with exit 1 if any probe binary is missing (line 63), preventing incomplete releases
2. **Validation:** fail_on_unmatched_files true ensures all expected assets are uploaded
3. **Debugging:** ls -la release-assets/ step (line 80) aids troubleshooting in workflow logs
4. **Resilience:** Uses find command instead of hardcoded paths, making extraction robust to directory structure changes
5. **Completeness:** Handles both Linux (.so) and Windows (.dll + .lib) artifacts with appropriate logic


### Human Verification Required

The following items cannot be verified programmatically and require actual workflow execution:

#### 1. End-to-End Release Creation

**Test:** Push a test version tag (e.g., v0.0.1-test) and observe the full workflow execution.

**Expected:**
- GitHub Actions triggers the release workflow automatically
- build-standard job completes successfully, producing 8 artifacts
- build-patched job completes successfully, producing 2 artifacts
- release job downloads all 10 artifacts
- Extraction script finds all 10 probe binaries and copies them with correct filenames
- SHA256SUMS file is generated with 15 checksum entries
- GitHub Release is created with tag name as title
- Release page shows 16 files: 10 .so/.dll probes + 5 .lib import libraries + SHA256SUMS
- Release notes are auto-generated from commits since last tag

**Why human:** GitHub Actions workflow execution behavior, artifact download/upload mechanisms, and GitHub Release UI can only be fully validated in the live CI environment. Static analysis verifies structure but not runtime behavior.

#### 2. Artifact Filename Correctness

**Test:** Download all 16 release assets and verify filenames match expected patterns.

**Expected:**
- 5 Linux probes: qtmcp-probe-qt5.15-linux-gcc.so, qtmcp-probe-qt6.2-linux-gcc.so, qtmcp-probe-qt6.8-linux-gcc.so, qtmcp-probe-qt6.9-linux-gcc.so, qtmcp-probe-qt5.15-patched-linux-gcc.so
- 5 Windows DLLs: qtmcp-probe-qt5.15-windows-msvc.dll, qtmcp-probe-qt6.2-windows-msvc.dll, qtmcp-probe-qt6.8-windows-msvc.dll, qtmcp-probe-qt6.9-windows-msvc.dll, qtmcp-probe-qt5.15-patched-windows-msvc.dll
- 5 Windows import libraries: matching .lib files for each .dll
- 1 checksum file: SHA256SUMS

**Why human:** Need to verify actual GitHub Release page UI, download artifacts, and confirm filenames are correct and distinguishable.

#### 3. SHA256SUMS Integrity

**Test:** Download SHA256SUMS file and verify checksums.

**Expected:**
- File contains exactly 15 lines (one per binary artifact)
- Each line has format: <64-char-hex-hash>  <filename>
- Running sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS with downloaded artifacts passes all checks
- All 15 filenames listed in SHA256SUMS match the actual release assets

**Why human:** Need to verify actual file contents, hash correctness, and checksum validation against downloaded binaries.

#### 4. CI Matrix Artifact Availability

**Test:** Verify that artifacts from both CI workflows are accessible to the release job.

**Expected:**
- actions/download-artifact@v4 successfully downloads all 10 artifact directories
- Each artifact directory contains the expected lib/qtmcp structure
- No artifacts are missing or corrupted
- Artifact names match the expected patterns from ci.yml and ci-patched-qt.yml

**Why human:** Artifact availability depends on GitHub Actions workflow_call artifact propagation, which can only be validated by actual execution.

#### 5. Release Failure Modes

**Test:** Simulate failure scenarios (e.g., remove an artifact from CI workflow temporarily) and verify workflow fails gracefully.

**Expected:**
- If a probe binary is missing, extraction script exits with error and workflow fails
- If fail_on_unmatched_files triggers, release creation fails with clear error message
- Workflow logs clearly indicate which artifact or file caused the failure
- No partial releases are created (all-or-nothing behavior)

**Why human:** Failure mode testing requires intentionally breaking the workflow and observing error handling, which cannot be done via static analysis.

## Verification Conclusion

**Status:** human_needed

**Summary:**

All automated structural checks passed. The release.yml workflow is complete, well-structured, and contains no anti-patterns or stubs. The implementation satisfies all observable truths from the must_haves specification:

1. ✓ Tag trigger configured correctly
2. ✓ Both CI workflows called as reusable workflows
3. ✓ All 10 probe binaries mapped with correct release filenames
4. ✓ SHA256SUMS generation implemented
5. ✓ GitHub Release creation via softprops/action-gh-release@v2

Requirements CICD-07 and CICD-08 are structurally satisfied.

**However:** The workflow's runtime behavior — artifact propagation, file extraction, checksum generation, and GitHub Release creation — can only be validated by pushing a test tag and observing the actual execution in GitHub Actions. The workflow is ready for human verification via a test release.

**Recommendation:** Push a test tag (e.g., v0.0.1-test) to verify end-to-end behavior, then delete the test release and tag if successful.
