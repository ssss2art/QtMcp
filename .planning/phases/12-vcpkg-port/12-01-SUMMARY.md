# Phase 12 Plan 01: vcpkg Source Overlay Port Summary

**One-liner:** vcpkg source port at ports/qtmcp/ that builds probe from GitHub against user's Qt installation

## What Was Built

Created a vcpkg overlay port that enables users to install QtMCP via:
```bash
vcpkg install qtmcp --overlay-ports=./ports
```

The port:
- Fetches source from GitHub (ssss2art/QtMcp)
- Delegates Qt detection to the project's own CMakeLists.txt
- Disables tests and test app builds for cleaner vcpkg integration
- Relocates CMake config files to vcpkg-standard paths
- Shows usage instructions after install

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ports/qtmcp/vcpkg.json | Port manifest - declares only cmake helper deps, no Qt |
| ports/qtmcp/portfile.cmake | Build instructions - vcpkg_from_github + cmake workflow |
| ports/qtmcp/usage | Post-install instructions - find_package and injection notes |

## Technical Details

**Port Manifest (vcpkg.json):**
- Name: qtmcp
- Version: 0.1.0
- Dependencies: vcpkg-cmake, vcpkg-cmake-config (host-only)
- NO Qt dependencies - user's Qt installation is used

**Portfile Flow:**
1. `vcpkg_from_github` fetches source (SHA512 placeholder until first release)
2. `vcpkg_cmake_configure` runs CMake with tests disabled
3. `vcpkg_cmake_install` builds and installs
4. `vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup` moves config from share/cmake/QtMCP to share/qtmcp
5. License and usage files installed

**CMake Options Passed:**
- `-DQTMCP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF` - skip test compilation
- `-DQTMCP_BUILD_TEST_APP=OFF` - skip test app
- `-DQTMCP_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF` - skip static analysis
- `-DQTMCP_DEPLOY_QT=OFF` - no windeployqt (vcpkg handles this)

## Decisions Made

1. **No Qt dependencies declared** - The port relies on Qt already being installed on the system (either via vcpkg or externally). This matches the Phase 9 decision to feature-gate Qt deps.

2. **SHA512 placeholder** - Using `SHA512 0` since no release tag exists yet. This is standard vcpkg practice for ports under development.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

The source port is complete. Plan 12-02 will add the binary download port as an alternative installation method for users who want prebuilt binaries.
