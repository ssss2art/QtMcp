# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 13-01
    provides: Download module and CLI subcommand architecture
provides:
  - Complete PyPI package metadata (classifiers, URLs, readme)
  - OIDC-based publishing workflow (no API tokens)
  - Package README for PyPI landing page
affects: [release-workflow, documentation]

# Tech tracking

  modified:
    - python/pyproject.toml

key-decisions:
  - "OIDC Trusted Publishers over API tokens for secure keyless publishing"
  - "Hatchling build backend for pure-Python wheel generation"
  - "Separate README for PyPI landing page vs repo README"

patterns-established:
  - "Trusted Publisher pattern: id-token: write + pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish + pypi environment"
  - "Package metadata pattern: classifiers, URLs, scripts in pyproject.toml"

# Phase 13 Plan 02: PyPI Metadata and Publishing Summary

**OIDC-based PyPI publishing workflow with complete package metadata and hatchling build backend**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-03T10:30:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-03T10:42:00Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Complete pyproject.toml with PyPI classifiers, URLs, and readme reference
- Package README.md optimized for PyPI landing page (90 lines)
- GitHub Actions workflow using Trusted Publishers (OIDC) - no API tokens needed
- Publishing triggers automatically on GitHub Release publication

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Complete pyproject.toml metadata for PyPI** - `f09d3e7` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create package README for PyPI** - `1526cd7` (docs)
3. **Task 3: Create PyPI publishing workflow with Trusted Publishers** - `92462e8` (feat)
4. **Task 4: Checkpoint verification** - User approved (no commit needed)

## Files Created/Modified
- `python/pyproject.toml` - Complete PyPI metadata with classifiers, URLs, and hatchling build
- `python/README.md` - PyPI landing page with installation, quick start, and feature overview
- `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml` - OIDC-based publishing workflow with GitHub environment

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| OIDC Trusted Publishers | Secure keyless publishing without storing API tokens in secrets |
| Hatchling build backend | Pure-Python wheel generation, modern build system |
| Separate PyPI README | Focused content for pip users (90 lines vs full repo docs) |
| GitHub environment "pypi" | Enables environment protection rules and deployment URL |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## User Setup Required

**External service requires manual configuration.** Before first release:

1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
2. Add pending publisher for "qtmcp" package:
   - GitHub repository owner: ssss2art
   - Repository name: QtMcp
   - Workflow name: publish-pypi.yml
   - Environment name: pypi
3. Create "pypi" environment in GitHub repository settings (optional but recommended)

## Next Phase Readiness
- PyPI publishing is fully automated on release
- First `pip install qtmcp` will work once Trusted Publisher is configured and v0.1.0 released
- Phase 13 (PyPI Publication) is now complete
