# Phase 13: PyPI Publication Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** pip install qtmcp gives users a working MCP server with a CLI to fetch the correct probe
**Verified:** 2026-02-03T22:54:04Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | pip install qtmcp installs cleanly from PyPI and provides qtmcp CLI entry point | VERIFIED | pyproject.toml has scripts entry point, wheel builds successfully |
| 2 | qtmcp download-probe --qt-version 6.8 fetches the correct probe binary | VERIFIED | CLI subcommand exists, download.py fully implemented, 27 tests pass |
| 3 | Package is pure-Python wheel (no compiled extensions, no bundled probe) | VERIFIED | Wheel tag is py3-none-any, Root-Is-Purelib: true |
| 4 | Publishing uses Trusted Publishers (OIDC), no API tokens | VERIFIED | publish-pypi.yml has id-token: write, uses pypa action |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

### Summary

Phase 13 goal achieved. All automated verification checks pass. Package is ready for PyPI publication once Trusted Publisher is configured.

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| cli.py | download.py | import | WIRED | Line 32: from qtmcp.download import |
| download.py | GitHub Releases | HTTP GET | WIRED | RELEASES_URL = github.com/releases/download |
| publish-pypi.yml | release event | trigger | WIRED | on: release: types: [published] |
| pyproject.toml | hatchling | build-system | WIRED | Builds py3-none-any wheel successfully |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| PYPI-01: Pure-Python wheel | SATISFIED |
| PYPI-02: CLI entry point | SATISFIED |
| PYPI-03: download-probe command | SATISFIED |
| PYPI-04: OIDC publishing | SATISFIED |

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. PyPI Trusted Publisher Configuration

**Test:** Configure Trusted Publisher on PyPI before first release

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
2. Add pending publisher for qtmcp:
   - Repository: ssss2art/QtMcp
   - Workflow: publish-pypi.yml
   - Environment: pypi

**Expected:** Publishing workflow can authenticate via OIDC

**Why human:** Requires PyPI account access and manual configuration

#### 2. First Release End-to-End Test

**Test:** Verify PyPI publishing and installation

**Steps:**
1. Create GitHub release (e.g., v0.1.0)
2. Verify publish-pypi.yml workflow succeeds
3. Check package on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/qtmcp/
4. Test: pip install qtmcp
5. Test: qtmcp --help
6. Test: qtmcp download-probe --qt-version 6.8

**Expected:** Package installs cleanly, CLI works, probe downloads

**Why human:** Requires actual PyPI deployment and network access

## Verification Methodology

### Test Results

**Unit tests:** 27/27 passed in 0.28s
- Platform Detection: 4 tests
- Version Normalization: 3 tests  
- URL Building: 4 tests
- Checksum Parsing: 3 tests
- Checksum Verification: 3 tests
- Download Probe: 3 tests
- Error Handling: 2 tests
- Get Probe Filename: 2 tests
- Available Versions: 2 tests

**Package build:**
Successfully built qtmcp-0.1.0.tar.gz and qtmcp-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

**Wheel properties:**
- Tag: py3-none-any (pure-Python)
- Root-Is-Purelib: true
- Entry point: qtmcp = qtmcp.cli:main
- No compiled extensions

**CLI test:**
qtmcp download-probe --help works correctly
Shows available versions: 5.15, 5.15-patched, 6.5, 6.8, 6.9
Documents platform auto-detection

### Key Implementation Features

**Platform detection:**
- Linux: linux-gcc suffix, .so extension
- Windows: windows-msvc suffix, .dll extension
- Raises UnsupportedPlatformError for others

**Version normalization:**
- 6.8 -> 6.8
- 6.8.0 -> 6.8
- 5.15-patched -> 5.15-patched (preserves suffix)

**Checksum verification:**
- Downloads SHA256SUMS first
- Verifies file matches checksum
- Raises ChecksumError on mismatch
- Deletes corrupted files
- Can be disabled with --no-verify

**OIDC workflow:**
- Triggers on release:published
- id-token:write permission
- Uses pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
- No password/token fields
- GitHub environment: pypi
