qtmcp-bin provides CMake targets:

  find_package(QtMCP CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE QtMCP::Probe)

The probe is loaded via injection (LD_PRELOAD on Linux, DLL injection on Windows).
See the project README for injection instructions.

Note: This is the prebuilt binary port. For building from source, use 'qtmcp' instead.
